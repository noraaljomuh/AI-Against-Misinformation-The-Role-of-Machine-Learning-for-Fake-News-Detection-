# AI Against Misinformation: Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning

This project was developed as part of the **ARTI406 â€“ Machine Learning** course at **Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University**. It implements and evaluates machine learning models for **fake news detection**, aiming to combat misinformation in digital media.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The system analyzes news article text and predicts whether it is **fake** or **real** based on linguistic and statistical features. Multiple machine learning algorithms were trained and compared to identify the most effective approach for this classification task.

**Key Highlights:**

* **Goal:** Automatically classify news as fake or real.
* **Dataset:** [Fake News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news) (Kaggle)
* **Models:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors
* **Best Accuracy Achieved:** **99.5%** with Logistic Regression
* **Languages & Tools:** Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, NLTK
